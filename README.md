# Vue Field Handlers

VueJS Field Handlers for Qobo `project-template-cakephp`.

It's a heavy plugin, as it contains some legacy code with jQuery dependencies, like:

* `bootstrap-datepicker`
* `icheck`
* `moment`
* `flag-icon-css`
* `daterangepicker`
* etc.

Throughout the time most of these dependencies will be deprecated and replaced with stand-alone vendor libraries with smaller footprint.
